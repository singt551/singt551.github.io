        In the notes that follow, I summarise the key issues
emerging from this dossier, and then sketch a tentat-
ive program of analysis and action that I think is made
necessary by the crisis of reproduction that women are
experiencing worldwide. First, however, I would like to
briefly comment on the history of the concept, to dispose
of the assumption that to speak of ‘social reproduction’ is
by itself to take a radical stance. This may seem a minor
point in the context of the present debates, but I think it
is worth emphasising that the idea of social reproduction
originated in the context of bourgeois economics to in-
dicate the processes by which a social system reproduces
itself. This is how ‘social reproduction’ was first concep-
tualised by the François Quesnay (1694–1774) and other
Enlightenment-era Physiocrats who, according to Marx,
were the first economists of capitalist society, and also
the first theorists to identify the nature of productive
labour with agricultural work
      </p>
      <p>
        Contrary to an assumption that runs through recent
works on social reproduction, to look at social reality
from this viewpoint is not itself to take a Marxist or a rad-
ical stand generally speaking. Social reproduction theor-
ists have included a wide range of promoters of capitalist
development. Thus, as an analytic category ‘social re-
production’ cannot be adopted as a form of a political
identification, as it is done by feminists describing them-
selves as ‘social reproduction theorists’.

        What made the discussion of social reproduction by
wages for housework theorists and activists in the 1970s
‘revolutionary’ (in my view) was not the field that they ex-
amined, but what they discovered, which is the existence
of a large area of exploitation until then unrecognised by
all revolutionary theorists, Marxist and anarchist alike.
It was discovering that unpaid labour is not extracted
by the capitalist class only from the waged workday, but
that it is also extracted from the workday of millions of
unwaged house-workers as well as many other unpaid
and un-free labourers. It was redefining the capitalist
function of the wage as a creator of labour hierarchies,
and an instrument serving to naturalise exploitative so-
cial relations and to delegate to wage-workers power
over the unwaged. It was unmasking the socio-economic
function of the creation of a fictional private sphere, and
thereby re-politicising family life, sexuality, procreation.
